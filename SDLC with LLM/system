🚆 Business Problem Definition — Transport Trend Classification System

European transport authorities need a data-driven way to classify annual passenger transport activity for each country into meaningful operational categories. The dataset provided (estat_ttr00015.tsv) contains yearly passenger-kilometres (million PKM) for multiple European countries from 2013 to 2024.

The goal of this project is to build a supervised classification model that assigns each country-year record into one of three transport trend categories:

Classification Labels

Decline – A year where transport activity decreases beyond a defined threshold.

Normal/Stable – Minor fluctuations within expected year-to-year variation.

Recovery/Growth – A year where transport activity increases significantly following a previous decline.

🎯 Business Objectives

This model will help policymakers and transport authorities:

Detect Transport Decline Early → enabling targeted intervention programs.

Monitor Post-Crisis Recovery (e.g., post-COVID transport patterns).

Allocate Budget & Infrastructure Investments based on classified trends.

Improve Accuracy of Transport Forecasting Models by incorporating trend categories as input features.

📏 Trend Classification Logic (Explicit Thresholds)

Thresholds will be calculated using % change year-to-year for each country:

Decline: Transport activity decreases by ≥ 5% compared to previous year

Normal: Change between -5% and +5%

Recovery/Growth: Increase of ≥ 5%, OR two or more consecutive increases

(Thresholds can be adjusted based on domain expert feedback.)

⚙️ Functional Requirements (Strictly derived from dataset)
Data Preparation

Parse annual passenger-kilometre values for each country.

Clean missing entries such as :@C by:

marking year as “missing”,

excluding from training, or

imputing if needed (decision documented).

Feature Engineering

Compute year-to-year percentage change for each country.

Normalise values if needed to ensure consistent scale.

Classification Output

For each country-year, produce:

Assigned label: Decline / Normal / Recovery

Supporting indicator: % change calculation

Provide results in a structured table (country, year, trend category).

📦 Project Scope (Clear & Manageable)
In-Scope

Classification of historical trend categories only

Using provided dataset without introducing external data

Handling missing values in the dataset

Threshold-based label generation

Model or rule-based classification approach

Output in a tabular format for downstream reporting/dashboards

Out of Scope

Forecasting future passenger transport values

Adding new features beyond what the dataset allows

Using additional socio-economic datasets

Recommender systems or simulation models

📊 Expected Business KPIs

Classification Accuracy ≥ 85% (validated on historical patterns)

Coverage: At least 90% of country-year records successfully classified

Time-to-Insight: Ability to classify entire dataset within seconds

5. As a Policy Maker, I want to view a table of classified trends so that I can quickly identify countries showing decline or recovery.
Acceptance Criteria

Table includes columns: Country | Year | Transport Value | % Change | Classification.

Table is sortable by country, year, and classification.

Missing values are clearly marked.

✅ TC-03: Sort by Country – Ascending

Type: Functional / Positive

Preconditions:

Table contains multiple countries (e.g., AT, BG, CH, CZ).

Steps:

Open the “Classified Trends” table.

Click on the Country column header to sort ascending.

Expected Result:

Rows are ordered alphabetically by Country (A → Z).

All rows remain visible with unchanged values; only the order changes.
