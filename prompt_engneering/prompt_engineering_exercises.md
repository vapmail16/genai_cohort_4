## Exercise 2: Pattern Practice

### Task: Email Validation Function

**Try these patterns:**

1. **Zero-Shot:** Direct request
2. **Few-Shot:** Show 2-3 examples of good functions
3. **Chain-of-Thought:** Ask for step-by-step reasoning
4. **Role-Playing:** "You are a senior developer..."
5. **Iterative:** First outline, then implement, then optimize

**Compare results - which works best?**

## Exercise 3: Prompt Chain Challenge

### Complex Task: Research and Write

**Break this into a prompt chain:**
"I need a technical blog post about Python async programming for intermediate developers, with code examples, explaining best practices, and including common pitfalls to avoid."

**Suggested Chain:**
1. Research: "Find key concepts about Python async programming..."
2. Outline: "Create an outline for a blog post covering..."
3. Write: "Write the introduction section..."
4. Expand: "Expand section 2 with code examples..."
5. Review: "Review for clarity and technical accuracy..."

## Exercise 4: The CRISPE Challenge

### Task: Create a prompt using CRISPE framework

**Given Task:** "Help me learn machine learning"

**Apply CRISPE:**
- **C**apacity & Role: ???
- **R**equest: ???
- **I**nsight: ???
- **S**tyle: ???
- **P**ersonality: ???
- **E**xperiment: ???

**Share and compare!**

## Exercise 5: Common Mistake Fix

### Fix These Prompts:

**1. Too Vague:**
"Help me with my code"

**2. Too Much Information:**
"I need help with my Python project. It's a web scraper. I'm using BeautifulSoup. I'm running Python 3.9. I'm on Windows. I have 16GB RAM. My code is doing something wrong but I'm not sure what. Can you help?"

**3. Multiple Tasks:**
"Write code, test it, document it, create a README, make it production-ready, and write a blog post about it"

**4. No Format:**
"Give me information about neural networks"

**5. Wrong Tone:**
"Explain quantum computing using advanced mathematical notation and assume PhD-level understanding" (for beginners)

## Exercise 6: Use Case Templates

### Create Prompts for These Scenarios:

**Scenario 1:** 
You're a junior developer who needs help debugging a complex function. The error message is cryptic.

**Scenario 2:**
You need to explain a technical concept to a non-technical stakeholder in 5 minutes.

**Scenario 3:**
You want to generate test data for your application that matches real-world patterns.

**Scenario 4:**
You need to refactor legacy code to modern standards while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Scenario 5:**
You're creating documentation that needs to be accessible to both beginners and experts.

## Exercise 7: Few-Shot Learning

### Style Transfer Example:

**Given these examples:**
```
Professional: "I would like to request your assistance with this matter."
Friendly: "Hey! Could you help me out with this?"
Formal: "I respectfully request your assistance in this matter."
```

**Task:** Convert this to each style:
"I need help with my project deadline."

**Try it with:**
- Email tones
- Code commenting styles
- Documentation formats
- Report structures

## Exercise 8: Chain-of-Thought Challenge

### Complex Problem:

**Problem:** "A company has 100 employees. 60% work remotely. 40% work in-office. Remote workers are 20% more productive but cost 15% less. In-office workers have better collaboration (30% improvement) but higher costs. Should they go fully remote?"

**Create a CoT prompt that:**
1. Breaks down the problem
2. Considers all factors
3. Calculates trade-offs
4. Provides recommendation with reasoning

---

## Exercise 9: Role-Playing Exercise

### Same Task, Different Roles:

**Task:** "Review this code snippet for potential issues"

**Try with different roles:**
1. "You are a security expert..."
2. "You are a performance optimization specialist..."
3. "You are a code reviewer focusing on readability..."
4. "You are a beginner-friendly mentor..."

**Compare the different perspectives!**

---

## Exercise 10: Real-World Challenge

### Your Actual Use Case:

**Instructions:**
1. Think of a real task you need help with
2. Write the worst possible prompt
3. Improve it using today's techniques
4. Share with the group
5. Get feedback and refine further

**This makes it immediately applicable to their work!**
